    <p class="intro">Hi everyone, my name is Xiandi, and I go by Cindy. I currently live in Greenville, South Carolina. I was born in China and immigrated to the States in middle school. I have a bachelor's degree in hospitality management and have worked in the service industry for two years after graduating in the summer of 2020. However, I became interested in coding in July of 2022 and had been studying independently since then. I like problem-solving and overcoming challenges, and I always want to step out of my comfort zone and challenge myself by learning different things. </p>
